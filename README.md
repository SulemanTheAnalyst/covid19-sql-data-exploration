## Key Analyses & Insights

### Death & Infection Analysis:
- Calculated death percentage per country.
- Determined infection rate as a percentage of the population.
- Identified countries with highest death counts and infection rates.

### Global Trend Aggregation:
- Summed up global new cases and deaths by date.
- Computed global death percentage over time.

### Vaccination Analysis:
- Tracked rolling vaccination totals using window functions.
- Used CTE and temp tables to calculate % of population vaccinated.
- Created views to support future dashboard visualizations.
